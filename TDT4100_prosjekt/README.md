The project is a replica of the board game Go. It follows traditional Chinese rules set. The program creates a board where each player can put pieces on the board. The game is over when a player passes twice in a row. When the game is over we have implemented a counting algorithm that will count the score of each player and reveal the winner of the game. This algorithm works best when most of the spaces are filled on the board.

As this is a school project where there are some solutions that are implemented that can be viewed as unnecessary or not optimal solutions. This is due to the fact of the given criteria for the subject. For example, many of the interfaces, the abstract class, the observer and observable technic are all implemented due to the course work and are not essential or optimal solutions in some situations of the project. 

The counting algorithm works by grouping all prices into groups of black and white and then checking if the group is dead or alive. If a group is alive its score will be counted.
